I have modified it and its much better from previous code Now can me made following changes in company setting under Challan Format do following changes 1. remove template thing as we are going with only one template 2. Under Display option I need only things that are Show Company Logo, Show Ganth Press Details and Show Weights and also remove footer note and transfer it to T&C and it should have only one line for T&C for challan Now also do following changes for Invoice format 1. Remove template style as we are going with only one template 2. logo position should have option to be in right or in left not center 3. Then you have given option for primary colour and acsent colour instead of that give option for colour and Black and white for colour it should have the exsisting bill colour and for black and white all the content should be in black including logo also. 4. Under display option I need only these contents Show Company Logo, Show Bank Details, Show Terms & Conditions, else things not required. Also when we are unchekking that then bill layout should not change it should be as it is and that section should be blank only. Heading should be there but not the content like text "Bank Details" should be there but account number etc should not be there Tax Display Style and Footer note should not be there. Also If we could get option for font, font style like bold, font size etc for both challan and invoice it will be more better
